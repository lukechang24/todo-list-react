# To-do List Process
For this project, I decided to split the work into two parts: the login page and the actual to-do list.

## Login
For the login, I created a simple form with an email and password input. I use the fetch function to make a call to the api endpoint to authenticate the user. At first, I struggled to receive a hit from the endpoint, but after thorough research of php data calls, I was able to resolve the issue. I make sure I have all the necessary components in before I focus on styling. This section took around an hour for me to complete.

## To-do List
The todo list was a bit harder to meet all requirements. I used React hooks to store the state, which allowed for easier state management. The hardest part was allowing the user to edit a single todo without moving anything else around. This section took around an hour and a half.
